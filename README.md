# Background & Idea Phases

## What is GameBackGG?
GameBackGG, also known as GameBack is an online platform for immersive and insightful feedback from gaming users based on your favorite games! Dive into a vibrant community where gamers share their experiences, opinions, and ratings to help you decide which games to play. The reason I chose GameBack as the brand name is because I figured that by putting "Game" + "Feed-Back", and removing the "Feed" from the phrase, it sounds catchy and easy to remember. Therefore, GameBack as the name creation was created.

## Background of the Project Idea
Around early January of 2024, I had this idea that everyone could review and rate any of the games they played/liked. My inspiration is coming from MyAnimeList particularly because I always use that website to give ratings on every anime I watch. 

## Research & Development on GameBackGG
After having such thought, I decided to do my research. Quickly, I discovered one website I am interested in which is popularly recognized, OpenCritic. So as a curious human being, I took my free time and checked out and I was surprised by how they operated and how they run their website which sparked my interest heavily.

## Why GameBackGG?
GameBackGG has a Better, Cleaner, and Simpler UI/UX design, it also considers and comes with the touch of smooth animations which give users a much more impact and a positive experience. With such features, why should users not use GameBackGG to provide and share some gaming feedback on games?
