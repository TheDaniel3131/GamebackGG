## What is GameBackGG?
GameBackGG, also known as GameBack is an online platform for immersive and insightful feedback from gaming users based on your favorite games! Dive into a vibrant community where gamers share their experiences, opinions, and ratings to help you decide which games to play. The reason of chose GameBack as the brand name is because I figured that by putting "Game" + "Feed-Back", and removing the "Feed" from the phrase, sounds catchy and easy to remember. Therefore, GameBack as the name creation was created.

## Background of the Project Idea
Around early of the year 2024, I had this idea that everyone could review and rate any of the games they played/liked. My inspiration is coming from MyAnimeList particularly because I always use that website to give ratings on every anime I watch. 

## Research & Development on GameBackGG
After having such thought, I decided to go do my research. Quickly, I found there is one website I am interested in which is popularly recognized, OpenCritic. So as a curious human being, I took my free time and checked out and I was surprised by how they operated and how they run their website which sparks my interest heavily.

## Why GameBackGG?
Clean and simple UI/UX design, also with the touch of smooth animations can give users much more impact and positive experience. With such features, why should not use GameBackGG to provide and share some gaming feedback on games?
